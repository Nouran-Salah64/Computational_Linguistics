# Computational Linguistics Pipeline — Arabic & English NLP System

A bilingual NLP pipeline built from scratch for Arabic and English text processing, developed as part of a computational linguistics project at the Faculty of Arts, Phonetics and Linguistics department.

---

## What It Does

- Builds a bilingual lexical database of 5,000 words covering English, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA)
- Handles dialectal variation including 2,000 dialectal Arabic entries
- Implements rule-based sentence and word segmentation for Arabic using Regex
- Includes a morphological analyzer, POS tagger, and syntactic parser built with handcrafted rules

---

## Technologies

- Python
- Regex
- Manual rule design and linguistic annotation

---

## Key Linguistic Challenges Addressed

- Arabic tokenization and segmentation
- Dialectal Arabic (ECA) vs Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) variation
- Arabic morphology including root-pattern structure
- Handcrafted syntactic parsing rules
